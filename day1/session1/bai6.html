        <h1>Aligning a Block of Content to the Right</h1>
        <p>
            You can use a DIV tag to align a block of content to the right.
        </p>
        <p>
            This content can include anything you like, including tables, images,
            lists, and so on. Note, however, that right-aligned lists often do
            not look very neat.
